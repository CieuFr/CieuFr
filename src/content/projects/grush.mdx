It was realised over a month, our game is a party game inspired by Overcooked but instead of cooking we wanted to focus on farming.

The core mechanic of this game is the ability to stack objects on top of each other in a pile and move with that pile.

But the higher the pile the more unstable it becomes so you have to manage it while dodging obstacle to bring your harvest to the city.
